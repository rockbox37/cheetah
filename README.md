## Architecture

Cheetah uses a **Smart Routing Architecture** with tiered workers to minimize compute costs:

- **Gateway** (`gateway/`) — Go/Fiber API handling REST requests, rate limiting, and auth
- **Smart Router** (`router/`) — Python service that classifies URLs and routes to the right tier
- **Tier 1: Fast Scraper** (`workers/fast/`) — Rust worker for static pages (reqwest + scraper)
- **Tier 2: Browser Scraper** (`workers/browser/`) — Node.js/Playwright for JS-rendered pages
- **Tier 3: Stealth Scraper** (`workers/stealth/`) — Proxy-based scraping for protected sites
- **AI Layer** (`ai/`) — Python/vLLM for structured extraction and semantic chunking

## Quick Start

Run the full stack (gateway + fast worker + Redis) with one command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

Each component has its own build tooling:

```bash
# Gateway (Go)
cd gateway && go run .

# Fast worker (Rust)
cd workers/fast && cargo run

# Browser worker (Node.js)
cd workers/browser && npm install && npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /v1/scrape` — Scrape a single URL
- `POST /v1/crawl` — Crawl a site recursively
- `POST /v1/extract` — Extract structured data via JSON schema
